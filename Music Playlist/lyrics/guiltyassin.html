                Drowning in the Blue Nile
                He sent me "Downtown Lights"
                I hadn't heard it in a while
                My boredom's bone-deep
                This cage was once just fine
                Am I allowed to cry?

                I dream of cracking locks
                Throwing my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
                Crashing into him tonight, he's a paradox
                I'm seeing visions, am I bad?
                Or mad? Or wise?

                What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
                One slip and falling back into the hedge maze
                Oh, what a way to die
                I keep recalling things we never did
                Messy top lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
                Without ever touching his skin
                How can I be guilty as sin?

                I keep these longings locked
                In lowercase, inside a vault
                Someone told me there's no such thing as bad thoughts
                Only your actions talk

                These fatal fantasies giving way to labored breath
                Taking all of me, we've already done it in my head
                If it's make-believe
                Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

                What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
                One slip and falling back into the hedge maze
                Oh, what a way to die
                My bedsheets are ablaze, I've screamed his name
                Building up like waves crashing over my grave
                Without ever touching his skin
                How can I be guilty as sin?

                What if I roll the stone away?
                They're gonna crucify me anyway
                What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
                If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
                They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
                I choose you and me religiously

                What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
                One slip and falling back into the hedge maze
                Oh, what a way to die
                I keep recalling things we never did
                Messy top lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
                Without ever touching his skin
                How can I be guilty as sin?

                He sent me "Downtown Lights"
                I hadn't heard it in a while
                Am I allowed to cry?
