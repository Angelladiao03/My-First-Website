                When the morning came, we
                Were cleaning incense off your
                Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again
                Laughing with my feet in your lap
                Like you were my closest friend
                "How'd we end up on the floor anyway?"
                You say
                "Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top ros√©
                That's how"
                I see you every day now

                And I chose you
                The one I was dancing with in New York
                No shoes
                Looked up at the sky and it was
                The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
                And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
                The mark they saw on my collarbone
                The rust that grew between telephones
                The lips I used to call home
                So scarlet, it was maroon

                When the silence came, we
                Were shaking blind and hazy
                How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
                Sobbing with your head in your hands
                Ain't that the way shit always ends
                You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
                Carnations you had thought were roses
                That's us
                I feel you, no matter what
                The rubies that I gave up

                And I lost you
                The one I was dancing with in New York
                No shoes
                Looked up at the sky and it was maroon
                The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
                And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
                The mark they saw on my collarbone
                The rust that grew between telephones
                The lips I used to call home
                So scarlet, it was maroon

                And I wake with your memory over me
                That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy
                (It was maroon)
                And I wake with your memory over me
                That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave

                The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
                And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet
                It was maroon
                The mark they saw on my collarbone
                The rust that grew between telephones
                The lips I used to call home
                So scarlet, it was maroon

                It was maroon
                It was maroon
