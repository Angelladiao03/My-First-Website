                You booked the night train for a reason
                So you could sit there in this hurt
                Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
                You're not sure which is worse

                Because I dropped your hand while dancing
                Left you out there standing
                Crestfallen on the landing
                Champagne problems
                Your mom's ring in your pocket
                My picture in your wallet
                Your heart was glass, I dropped it
                Champagne problems

                You told your family for a reason
                You couldn't keep it in
                Your sister splashed out on the bottle
                Now no one's celebrating

                Dom PÃ©rignon, you brought it
                No crowd of friends applauded
                Your hometown skeptics called it
                Champagne problems
                You had a speech, you're speechless
                Love slipped beyond your reaches
                And I couldn't give a reason
                Champagne problems

                Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
                November flush and your flannel cure
                "This dorm was once a madhouse"
                I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
                How evergreen, our group of friends
                Don't think we'll say that word again
                And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
                That we once walked through
                One for the money, two for the show
                I never was ready, so I watch you go
                Sometimes you just don't know the answer
                'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
                "She would've made such a lovely bride
                What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
                But you'll find the real thing instead
                She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

                And hold your hand while dancing
                Never leave you standing
                Crestfallen on the landing
                With champagne problems
                Your mom's ring in your pocket
                Her picture in your wallet
                You won't remember all my
                Champagne problems

                You won't remember all my
                Champagne problems
