                State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
                I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
                So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
                That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
                By the way...

                I hate that stupid old pickup truck
                You never let me drive
                You're a redneck heartbreak
                Who's really bad at lying
                So watch me strike a match
                On all my wasted time
                As far as I'm concerned
                You're just another picture to burn!

                There's no time for tears
                I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
                There's nothing stopping me
                From going out with all of your best friends
                And if you come around saying sorry to me
                My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

                'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
                You never let me drive
                You're a redneck heartbreak
                Who's really bad at lying
                So watch me strike a match
                On all my wasted time
                As far as I'm concerned
                You're just another picture to burn!

                And if you're missing me
                You'd better keep it to yourself
                'Cause coming back around here
                Would be bad for your health...

                'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
                You never let me drive
                You're a redneck heartbreak
                Who's really bad at lying
                So watch me strike a match
                On all my wasted time
                In case you haven't heard
                I really really hate that...

                Stupid old pickup truck
                You never let me drive
                You're a redneck heartbreak
                Who's really bad at lying
                So watch me strike a match
                On all my wasted time
                As far as I'm concerned
                You're just another picture to burn!

                Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
                You're just another picture to burn
                Baby, burn...
