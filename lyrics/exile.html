                I can see you standin', honey
                With his arms around your body
                Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all
                And it took you five whole minutes
                To pack us up and leave me with it
                Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

                I think I've seen this film before
                And I didn't like the ending
                You're not my homeland anymore
                So what am I defendin' now?
                You were my town
                Now I'm in exile seein' you out
                I think I've seen this film before

                Hoo, hoo-ooh
                Hoo, hoo-ooh
                Hoo, hoo-ooh

                I can see you starin', honey
                Like he's just your understudy
                Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
                Second, third, and hundredth chances
                Balancin' on breaking branches
                Those eyes add insult to injury

                I think I've seen this film before
                And I didn't like the ending
                I'm not your problem anymore
                So who am I offending now?
                You were my crown
                Now I'm in exile seein' you out
                I think I've seen this film before
                So I'm leavin' out the side door

                So step right out
                There is no amount
                Of cryin' I can do for you

                All this time
                We always walked a very thin line
                You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
                You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

                All this time
                I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
                I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
                'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
                So many signs
                So many signs (You didn't even see the signs)

                I think I've seen this film before
                And I didn't like the ending
                You're not my homeland anymore
                So what am I defending now?
                You were my town
                Now I'm in exile seein' you out
                I think I've seen this film before
                So I'm leaving out the side door

                So step right out
                There is no amount
                Of cryin' I can do for you

                All this time
                We always walked a very thin line
                You didn't even hear me out (didn't even hear me out)
                You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

                All this time
                I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
                I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
                'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
                You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
                (So many times) I never learned to read your mind
                (So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
                'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
                You never gave a warning sign
                Ah, ah
