                Say you're sorry
                That face of an angel
                Comes out just when you need it to
                As I paced back and forth all this time
                'Cause I honestly believed in you
                Holding on
                The days drag on
                Stupid girl
                I should have known, I should have known

                That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
                I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
                Lead her up the stairwell
                This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
                I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
                Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

                Maybe I was na√Øve
                Got lost in your eyes
                And never really had a chance
                My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
                You had to fight to have the upper hand
                I had so many dreams
                About you and me
                Happy endings
                Now I know

                That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
                I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
                Lead her up the stairwell
                This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
                I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
                Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

                And there you are on your knees
                Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
                Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

                'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairy tale
                I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
                This is a big world, that was a small town
                There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
                And it's too late for you and your white horse
                Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

                Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
                Try and catch me now
                Oh, it's too late
                To catch me now
