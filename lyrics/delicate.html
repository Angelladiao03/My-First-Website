                This ain't for the best
                My reputation's never been worse, so
                You must like me for me
                We can't make
                Any promises now, can we, babe?
                But you can make me a drink

                Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
                Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
                Come here, you can meet me in the back
                Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
                Oh damn, never seen that color blue
                Just think of the fun things we could do

                'Cause I like you
                This ain't for the best
                My reputation's never been worse, so
                You must like me for me
                Yeah, I want you
                We can't make
                Any promises now, can we, babe?
                But you can make me a drink

                Is it cool that I said all that?
                Is it chill that you're in my head?
                'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
                Is it cool that I said all that?
                Is it too soon to do this yet?
                'Cause I know that it's delicate
                Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
                Isn't it?
                Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
                Isn't it?
                Delicate

                Third floor on the West Side, me and you
                Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
                Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
                Long night, with your hands up in my hair
                Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
                Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

                'Cause I like you
                This ain't for the best
                My reputation's never been worse, so
                You must like me for me
                Yeah, I want you
                We can't make
                Any promises now, can we, babe?
                But you can make me a drink

                Is it cool that I said all that?
                Is it chill that you're in my head?
                'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
                Is it cool that I said all that?
                Is it too soon to do this yet?
                'Cause I know that it's delicate
                Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
                Isn't it?
                Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
                Isn't it?
                Delicate

                Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
                Are you ever dreaming of me?
                Sometimes when I look into your eyes
                I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
                'Cause I like you

                Is it cool that I said all that?
                Is it chill that you're in my head?
                'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
                Yeah, I want you
                Is it cool that I said all that?
                Is it too soon to do this yet?
                'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
                'Cause I like you
                Is it cool that I said all that?
                Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
                Is it chill that you're in my head?
                Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
                'Cause I know that it's delicate
                Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
                (Yeah, I want you)
                Is it cool that I said all that?
                Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
                Is it too soon to do this yet?

                (Isn't it?)
