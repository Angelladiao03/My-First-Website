                Midnight
                You come and pick me up, no headlights
                Long drive
                Could end in burning flames or paradise
                Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

                I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
                Know exactly where it leads but I
                Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

                You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
                And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
                And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
                'Cause we never go out of style
                We never go out of style

                You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
                And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
                And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
                'Cause we never go out of style
                We never go out of style

                So it goes
                He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
                Takes me home
                Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah
                I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

                He says, "What you've heard is true but I
                Can't stop thinking about you," and I
                I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

                'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
                And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
                And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
                'Cause we never go out of style
                We never go out of style

                You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
                And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
                And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
                'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
                We never go out of style

                Take me home
                Just take me home, yeah
                Just take me home
                (Out of style)

                You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
                And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
                And when we go crashing down (when we go)
                We come back every time
                'Cause we never go out of style
                We never go out of style
